# Advanced DMA CSGO Cheating software
Lychee is a demonstration of advanced cheating techniques for DMA (direct memory access) cheating on counter strike global offensive.

## Features
Features of lychee-csgo include:
- Vulkan and direct X Accelerated graphics using wgpu
- bilboard shader accelerated ESP boxes for fuser overlay
- advanced radar rendering using wgpu
- advanced triggerbot and aimbot using microcontroller mouse passthrough device
- optional bunnyhop using memory writes
- modular feature gates for functions and memory access types
- works for DMA, readprocessmemory, KVM hypervisor, and more using memflow-rs
